# Lightning-generated whistlers recognition for accurate disaster monitoring in China and its surrounding areas based on the homologous dual-feature information enhancement framework

## :book:Introduction

DIEF is the **first detection framework** to apply **homologous dual features** to lightning-generated whistlers recognition, and it has achieved leading performance on the dataset collected by the Zhangheng-1 satellite. The feature encoder is used to extract feature information, and the time-frequency spectrum features and waveform signal features are integrated through multi-head attention. In this way, two types of features are combined without being limited by the spatial difference in feature information. Moreover, our DIEF achieves advanced performance on the UrbanSound8k dataset.
