## :book:Introduction

DIEF is the **first detection framework** to apply **homologous dual features** to lightning-generated whistlers recognition, and it has achieved leading performance on the dataset collected by the Zhangheng-1 satellite. The feature encoder is used to extract feature information, and the time-frequency spectrum features and waveform signal features are integrated through multi-head attention. In this way, two types of features are combined without being limited by the spatial difference in feature information. Moreover, our DIEF achieves advanced performance on the UrbanSound8k dataset.

## :star:Overview

![overview](./assets/dief.jpg)

- Created with 10,200 lightning-generated whistlers of Zhang heng-1 datasets.
- A homologous dual-feature information enhancement algorithm is proposed.
- Developed three versions of the Dual-feature Information Enhancement Framework (DIEF).
- Two different types of datasets prove the good robustness of our DIEF.
